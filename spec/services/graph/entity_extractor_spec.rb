      On their left was the precipitous Jersey shore, and on their right the towering buildings of the great city. Over
      the water the late afternoon sun spread a warm, mellow glow and touched with gold the myriad windows of the
      clustering skyscrapers across the river. The man knocked out his pipe with calm deliberation and turned his wide,
      gray eyes to the lofty Palisades, now bathed in a dazzling crimson. Then slowly his glance wandered back to where
      the shimmering light fell across the little shanty on the barge and picked out in hold relief the incongruously new
      and shining letters, _Minnie M. Baxter_. A smile lighted up his lined, weary features, a smile of pride in ownership.
      "She ain't so bad fer the old battle-axe that she is, hey Skippy?" he called to the boy. The boy's tousled head
      appeared from around the battered cabin. "I'll say she ain't, Pop," he answered. "An' she's _ours_! Gee, I can't
      believe my pop really an' truly owns a _whole_ barge!" The man laughed, then listened for a moment to a significant
      sound emanating from the muffled engine.
