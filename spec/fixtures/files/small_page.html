  <h1>What's GNU? Gnu's Not Unix!</h1>
  <p>GNU, which stands for Gnu's Not Unix, is the name for the complete Unix-compatible software system which I am writing so that I can give it away free to everyone who can use it [1]. Several other volunteers are helping me. Contributions of time, money, programs and equipment are greatly needed.</p>
  <p>Thank you.</p>
